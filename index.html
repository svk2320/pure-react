<!-- createElement just replaces the jsx then everything is the same

you've pretty much just seen what it is that jsx does.

jsx just simplifies this entire process, but we're still writing functional components.

Everything else about these components is the exact same.

It's really just the fact that with Gsx it looks a lot more like readable.

HTML As far as dictating what UI we want to render, reading, react or create element, this is a lot

more difficult on our eyes as developers in order to actually write this code.

But it's really simple. -->
